# About

This dataset contains information about the events that have taken
place at the World Cup from 1930 to 2014. All the information regarding the 
players, teams, matches etc was found in the dataset.

Few of the questions I tried to answer while analyzing the dataset were:

1 Which country has won the most World Cups?

2 Which country has scored the most goals at the World Cup 

3 Which edition of the World Cup had the highest attendance and  Which
matches had the highest attendance?

4 Which cities and stadiums have hosted the most number of matches?
